<h1>Rodion's Racuous Reels</h1>
<h2>Best movies of all time, according to me</h2>
<hr />
<h2>Robocop</h2>
<p>The quintessential 80s power fantasy. It's also a strong contender for the most influential action flick of all time, tied with Alien and The Terminator.</p>
<h2>The Incredibles</h2>
<p>It's pretty difficult to think of a favorite movie, but this is just a solid choice, no matter how you rank. It's got great visuals, a solid plot and is generally a great deal of fun. Second one falls so flat it hurts.</p>
<h2>Mad Max: Fury Road</h2>
<p>Despite the plethora of feminism-addled characters, and an ultra-simplistic plot, it's just so, so good. The visuals, the characters, evrything about this movie is just unforgettable. You just want to dive into the movie's universe and keep experiencing it. I long and dread a sequel.</p>
